**When you join the organization:**

**How to Think Holistically**
<br />
Holistic Thinking is the ability to understand the big picture of how your work impacts the partner team, the application they are working on, and the end user of the product. This can be done by incorporating your understanding in asking questions to better flesh out features and ensure that the changes the partner team make address all these factors, rather than strictly implementing a request as specified.

- Become a problem solver, not a task completer
- Better understand the value my work and I am more capable of delivering the best solution
