### **Expectations Management**
This is the ability to understand the scope of assigned work, derive the level of effort associated with it, and work with stakeholders to come up with reasonable, realistic timeframes for when the work will be delivered.

A mid-level developer should be able to agree to reasonable, realistic timelines for work requested, proactively alert stakeholders when expectations will not be met and provides updates on progress in appropriate intervals.

It also involves presenting relevant stakeholders alternatives for requests that cannot realistically be met, along with clear pros and cons of each option and a recommendation for which option to pursue.

Proactively informing clients of schedule slippage along with potential mitigation steps leads to increased trust in your ability to meet their needs

-------

**Here are ways to manage your stakeholders expectations:**

1. **When assigned work on a team project:**
- ensure you understand the scope of assigned work
- derive the level of effort associated with the work by carrying out proper estimations
- work with stakeholders to come up with reasonable, realistic timeframes for when the work will be delivered
- provide updates on your progress at appropriate intervals
- Before communicating your status, compare current progress to anticipated timelines to proactively identify any slips in the original schedule for delivery


2. **When a client or team lead sets expectations that are unrealistic:**
- tactfully say no and explain why the expectations are unrealistic
- clearly communicate the reasons why the expectations cannot be met, or discuss the resources that would be necessary to meet the expectations
- suggest alternatives to the unrealistic expectations


3. **When it becomes apparent that you will be unable to meet expectations in completing a task:**
- Come up with thoughtful recommendations for mitigating the slip in the schudule
- proactively alert stakeholders to the anticipated slip in schedule
- immediately reach out to stakeholders with the cause and impact of the slip, your recommendations and a revised timeframe for delivery
- explain why you will not be able to meet the expectation and present alternatives, including the pros and cons of each alternative
