### **Mentorship**
This is the ability to mentor more junior engineers by providing specific guidance on technical issues and business situations as they occur.

Mentorship starts with realizing that your experience and knowledge are of tremendous value to other people and you do not need to wait for someone to ask specifically for your help before you offer your support.

**Here are behaviours that display mentorship:**

A. **When you have learning experiences that you think could add value to many junior engineers experience,**
- document them and share with junior engineers through appropriate avenues (e.g. slack channels)

B. **When you notice that an engineer could benefit from your guidance on a technical or business issue,**
- offer them your support

C. **When an engineer asks for help,**
- offer them support and guidance in a way that does not require you to do the work for them

D. **When providing support or guidance to another engineer,**
- ensure that they're actually learning and not just getting an answer

E. **Within 2 weeks of mentoring an engineer,**
- check in with them and see if they learned from the mentorship experience and if there is anything else you can do to support
