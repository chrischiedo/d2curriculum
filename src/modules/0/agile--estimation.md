### **Agile Estimation**
Estimation in an agile team is the ability to systematically break down work into individual tasks and provide estimates on each to ultimately derive an estimate on the level of effort and time required to complete the work.

As a mid-level engineer you should be able to defend how you came up with an estimate for a task.

------

**Here are ways to carry out proper estimation of tasks in a team:**

1. **Before you begin assigned work,**
- break down the work into smaller individual tasks

2. **After breaking down the work into smaller individual tasks,**
- estimate the level of effort/time it will take to complete those tasks

3. **After estimating the level of effort for the tasks,**
- communicate the estimates with relevant stakeholders while providing justifications for the estimates

4. **After the tasks have been completed,**
- compare the actual level of effort to the estimated level of effort to re-calibrate my ability to estimate accurately
