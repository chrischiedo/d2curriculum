At Andela, the software development team you will be working with is called your Partner. Your partner team can be located anywhere across the globe and you will have to work remotely with the team.

A remote team is quite different from a distributed team. Didn’t know that? Well let’s have a look at the difference.

A remote team has no physical onsite office and team members are dispersed across the globe and can work from any location such as home offices or cafes.

A distributed engineering team is a software development team that consists of a hybrid of onsite and remote team members. It includes a physical office where some team members work from as well as other members of the team working from other locations.
