# **Seeking Feedback**

## **Overview**

At Andela, we know that our sum is greater than our parts, which is why collaboration is one of our core values. Collaboration can be implemented by seeking feedback and implementing the feedback received.

When we share our ideas or work with others, we receive insights that can improve our work quality and help us grow as well. Giving and receiving feedback is an integral part of the Andela culture.
