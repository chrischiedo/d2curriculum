## **Overview**

Data Structures and Algorithms are some of the most fundamental concepts that any software engineer worth their salt should have a deep understanding of. This module covers the most important concepts on Data Structures and Algorithms that every software developer should be familiar with.

## **Learning Outcomes**
### **At the end of this module, the learner should be able to:**
1. Understand how to design and implement the most common algorithms in Ruby.
2. Understand the most common data structures used in Ruby.
3. Explain how the choice of a particular algorithm/data structure might affect the performance of their application.
