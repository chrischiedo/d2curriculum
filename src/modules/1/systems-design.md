## **Overview**

Any software project (or application) will invariably have many 'moving parts', or subsystems that need to interface with one another in order to accomplish a desired goal. Consequently, a good understanding of system design is crucial for every software developer. This module covers the most important concepts of systems design.

## **Learning Outcomes**
### **At the end of this module, the learner should be able to:**
1. Understand how to design fault-tolerant, resilient and robust software systems.
2. Explain how trade-offs apply to software systems design.
