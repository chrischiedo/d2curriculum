## **Overview**

Any developer who works in a team needs to have a strong understanding of Version Control. This is a vital skill that enables software developers to keep track of changes that they make while working on their projects. This module covers version control concepts that are important to distributed teamwork.

## **Learning Outcomes**
### **At the end of this module, the learner should be able to:**
1. Describe how a distributed version control system works.
2. Understand how git rebasing and stashing works.
