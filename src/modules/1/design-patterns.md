## **Overview**

"*A design pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.*" ~ *Christopher Alexander*.
Software design patterns describe common (reusable) solutions to common software engineering problems. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular problem in your program. This module covers the most important software design patterns that are essential to software developers.

## **Learning Outcomes**
### **At the end of this module, the learner should be able to:**
1. Understand the most common types of software design patterns.
2. Apply design patterns to solve real world software engineering problems.
