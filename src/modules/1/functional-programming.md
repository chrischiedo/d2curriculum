## **Overview**

Functional programming has gained a lot of attention more recently among software developers. It is a programming paradigm that values immutability of state and the notion of higher-order functions. This module covers the most important Functional Programming concepts that a modern software engineer should be familiar with.

## **Learning Outcomes**
### **At the end of this module, the learner should be able to:**
1. Understand important Functional Programming concepts e.g. Pure Functions, Higher-order Functions, Closures, Recursion, Referential Transparency, etc
2. Write software programs in a functional style
3. Explain how using FP concepts makes programs more efficient and less error-prone.
