A developer should be able to use simple Rails performance tricks and tools, including profiling to optimize their applications. They should be able to measure the optimization effect, write and run optimization tests. They should also be able to tune up both the deployment infrastructure and the Ruby interpreter itself for optimal performance. This module covers the important concepts of performance optimization and why it's an important skill have as a developer.

## **Learning Outcomes**
### **At the end of this module, the learner should be able to:**
