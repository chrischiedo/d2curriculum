## **Overview**

Most modern applications will have to interact with other applications (e.g your application might need to consume other software artefacts/resources that were developed by another engineer). This is where API (Application Programming Interface) design becomes very important. This module covers the fundamental concepts of API design and how APIs are built in Rails.

## **Learning Outcomes**
### **At the end of this module, the learner should be able to:**
1. Understand the fundamental concepts of API design
2. Demonstrate the ability of building APIs using Rails.
