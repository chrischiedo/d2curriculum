## **Overview**

Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a conventional way for us to connect object-oriented programming languages, such as Ruby, with relational databases, in a logical way. The convention is to map, by equating classes with database tables and instances of those classes with the tables' rows. This module explores Active Record and general ORM concepts.

## **Learning Outcomes**
### **At the end of this module, the learner should be able to:**
1. Understand how ORMs work.
